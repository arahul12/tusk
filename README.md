# Laptop
A laptop computer, sometimes called a notebook computer by manufacturers, is a battery- or AC-powered personal computer generally smaller than a briefcase that can easily be transported and conveniently used in temporary spaces such as on airplanes, in libraries, temporary offices, and at meetings. A laptop typically weighs less than 5 pounds and is 3 inches or less in thickness. Among the best-known makers of laptop computers are IBM, Apple, Compaq, Dell, and Toshiba.
## History
1.)The Epson HX-20 (also known as the HC-20) was the first "true" laptop computer. It was invented in July 1980 by Yukio Yokozawa, who worked for Suwa Seikosha, a branch of Japanese company Seiko (now Seiko Epson), receiving a patent for the invention.

It was announced in 1981 as the HC-20 in Japan,and was introduced by Epson in North America as the HX-20 at the 1981 COMDEX computer show in Las Vegas, where it drew significant attention for its portability.

2.)Displays reached 640x480 (VGA) resolution by 1988 (Compaq SLT/286), and color screens started becoming a common upgrade in 1991,[24] with increases in resolution and screen size occurring frequently until the introduction of 17" screen laptops in 2003.

Hard drives started to be used in portables, encouraged by the introduction of 3.5" drives in the late 1980s, and became common in laptops starting with the introduction of 2.5" and smaller drives around 1990; capacities have typically lagged behind physically larger desktop drives.

3.)They started as a more affordable version of the Contura line, but after that they replaced Contura as a mainstream laptop line, and then the hi-end Compaq LTE line were merged with Armada as a premium 7300 and 7700 sub-lines. ![pic sum](https://github.com/arahul12/tusk/blob/main/300px-Siemens_PCD-3Psx.jfif)

4.)The IdeaPad laptops were announced in January 2008.The first three models in the product line were the Y710, the Y510, and the U110. Some of the features that defined these first three models were widescreens, VeriFace facial recognition, frameless screens, touch controls, and Dolby speaker systems. ![pic sum](https://github.com/arahul12/tusk/blob/main/330px-ThinkPad_X220.jpg)
The IdeaPad design marked a deviation from the business-oriented ThinkPad laptops, towards a more consumer-oriented look and feel
